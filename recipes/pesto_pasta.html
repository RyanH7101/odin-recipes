    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This leafy green cabbage-like vegetable is a genuine superfood - it's great whizzed up in place of basil in an Italian sauce</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>85g pine nut, toasted</li>
      <li>85g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), coarsely grated, plus extra to serve (optional)/li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>75ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li>
      <li>75ml olive oil</li>
      <li>85g kale</li>
      <li>juice 1 lemon</li>
      <li>spaghetti or linguine, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the pine nuts, Parmesan, garlic, oils, kale and lemon juice in a food processor and whizz to a paste. Season to taste. Stir through hot pasta to serve, topping with extra Parmesan and olive oil, if you like.</li>
      <li>To store, put in a container or jar, cover the surface with a little more olive oil and keep in the fridge for a week, or freeze for up to a month.</li>
    </ol>
